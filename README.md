Reduces volume of Spotify while someone is talking in TeamSpeak.

This actually seems to work for some crazy reason.

I'm feeling so ashamed of my code. I've never before even touched C++ and I probably won't touch it again unless I have to.
But for some reason it's working and it's probably leaking memory like crazy. If that's the case, which is, as I said, likely, just close your TeamSpeak every 10 days or so.
